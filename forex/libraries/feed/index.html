<p>### Trade in the opposite directions with HedgeTerminalApi library!</p>
<p>HedgeTerminalApi is a program interface allowing you to use HedgeTerminal virtualization technologies in your robots and scripts. With HedgeTerminalApi, you are able to trade in the opposite directions when two or more trading algorithms occupy opposite positions on a single symbol. The library allows robots to track their positions even if these positions overlap entirely or partially. Moreover, with this library, you are able to connect your robots to <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/5011#full_description">HedgeTerminalUltimate</a> visual panel. The library displays the actions of your robots and their oppositely directed positions in real time rising your work to the new level.</p>
<p>HedgeTerminalApi is not a loose collection of functions or a separate solution for a narrow range of tasks. HedgeTerminalApi is a convenient programmic access to powerful virtualization technologies implemented by all products of HedgeTerminal series. The library provides your business processes with the reliable virtualization and multidirectional trading technologies. It can be used for the development of complex trading systems consisting of the plenty of independent elements. </p>
<p><strong>HedgeTerminalApi</strong> has many beneficial features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliability.</strong> This was the key feature when developing the software architecture. HedgeTerminal contains thousands of source code lines. The ultimate objective of the most of its codes is ensuring reliability. Since HedgeTerminal is a specialized infrastructure solution, its overall reliability level is crucial to its success. That is why HedgeTerminal compares favorably with custom solutions. In order to develop a solution of a similar level, a user would have to develop infrastructure algorithms exceeding the size of the trading code itself dozens of times. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ability to connect to HedgeTerminalUltimate panel</strong>. If you have purchased HedgeTerminalUltimate visual panel, you can use it to track the status of your trading robots. Moreover, this panel allows you to do the following things on the fly without the need to re-launch your algorithms: place or change stop loss or take profit levels, forcefully close positions of your Expert Advisors, analyze results of your trading robots in real time and on history in the convenient and modern table of positions.</li>
<li><strong>Using on remote VPS</strong> <strong>and simultaneous work on different computers</strong>. Major part of the data used for virtualization is derived from the information about an account, its trades and orders. This means that your library copies can see each other&#8217;s positions and manage only their parts of positions regardless of where and in what quantity they have been launched, provided that they are connected to a single account. For example, you can install the virtualization library with your robots on a remote VPS and monitor their activity from your home PC via HedgeTerminalUltimate that displays the status and positions of your algorithms in real time.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity and functionality.</strong> The library API resembles the syntax of MQL5 system functions. If you know this programming language, you can easily make sense of the library API. For example, the analog of HistoryDealSelect function in HedgeTerminalApi is HedgeDealSelect, while the analog of OrderSelect function is HedgeOrderSelect. Moreover, while MQL5 grants access to order and deal properties as if they were unrelated transactions, the program interface of HedgeTerminal arranges more high-level access to that data. For example, using its API, you can select the necessary position and find out what orders it includes and what trades that orders consist of. Besides, positions, orders and trades provide advanced properties that are not available in MQL5 directly. For example, you can find out the price the order/position was actually executed at, or receive the position slippage value.</li>
<li><strong>Free use in the test mode</strong>. You can develop and test the robots using virtualization technologies for free. You do not have to purchase the license to use the library in test mode. Develop robots to order and test the technology for free.</li>
<li><strong>Features.</strong> If you are an advanced trader having HedgeTerminalUltimate, its features may not be enough for you. If you want to automate your trading, create your own report system based on HedgeTerminal, use complex position tracking methods or apply some other things, HedgeTerminalApi can be extremely useful. It has well-developed API allowing you to access even the values and the properties not displayed in HedgeTerminalUltimate. Besides, API functions allow you to use complex position tracking that is limited or unavailable in the panel.<br />
<strong>How <em>*</strong>to start using the library right now?</em>* Comments section contains detailed instructions for installing HedgeTerminalApi. The video on installing and using HedgeTerminalApi is to be provided soon.</li>
