<p><em>*The Beast Super Signal has been updated and completely revised! *</em>   </p>
<p><em>*The Beast Super Signal is a simple, and easy to use trend based indicator. It will continuously monitor the current price action looking for new trends establishing or strong reversals building at extreme overbought, and oversold levels and trends that have reached strong exhaustion levels. *</em></p>
<p><strong>The Beast Super Signal indicator will monitor the current price, and only when all of the internal strategies align, and are in 100% agreement with each other, the indicator will paint a new buy or sell signal arrow on the chart. All you need to do is buy or sell when you get a new arrow alert, no additional confirmation is needed!</strong></p>
<p><em>*The Beast Super Signal indicator can be used on ALL Currency pairs, Indices, Commodities, and Cryptocurrency pairs! *</em></p>
<p><strong>The indicator is extremely versatile and can be used <em>*</em><em></strong>successfully *</em>on all time frames! <br />
**</p>
<p><strong>This indicator is 100% NON repainting! It will never recalculate or back paint!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note the indicator is NOT optimized for trading Stocks or Binary Options!</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>The indicator now has a new Trade Panel displaying all trade information and signal statistics!</strong></p>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>The Beast Super Signal indicator will give you Entry, Stop Loss, and 3 X Take Profit level suggestions which you can use if preferred. </p>
<p>There are 2 input options for calculating how the TP &amp; SL levels are calculated on the chart. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>TP &amp; SL levels are calculated using average daily range volatility.</p>
<ol>
<li>TP &amp; SL levels are calculated using Risk &amp; Reward ratios 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3.   </li>
</ol>
<p>There is a Trade Panel that will display account details and all the trade and signal information and statistics. It will calculate the amount of signals, total profit, how many times it hit TP, profit factor and the indicators success rate. The panel is fully editable so you can change the colors and the size to your personal preference. It is also a great tool for manual back testing when looking for the optimal settings for your trading. </p>
<p><em>There are two additional filters to increase or decrease the amount and frequency of signals, the Signal Strength Period and the Volatility Percentage Filter. The higher the filters are set the fewer signals you will have, but with increased accuracy. You can change the inputs to your preferred level for trading</em>.  </p>
<p>The indicator has multiple alert options including pop up alert, email alert and push notification alert. </p>
