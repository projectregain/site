<p>A polynomial analyzing indicator. This is a free demo version of the <strong>&#8220;Fast Polynom moving average and channel&#8221;</strong> indicator. It&#8217;s only limitation is that it ignores the first 300 bars.</p>
<p>The use of a polynomial expansion of data opens up new possibilities for analysis and decision making. But the problem of all existing algorithms is a very slow computation.</p>
<p>The main feature of this indicator is its fast algorithm. The speed of calculation of the polynomial algorithm and its standard deviation values ​​is several thousand times faster than conventional algorithms. So this is a convenient algorithm for use without the need to apply supercomputers.</p>
<p>The indicator provides a built-in strategy tester with trade visualization and simultaneous calculation of profit (in pips), of maximal drawdown (in pips), of the total number of trades and the Profit Factor (total profit/total loss), and display of this data as a table. 10 strategy examples are available: 5 channel and 5 non-channel, as well as their inverse strategies (Sell and Buy are reversed). The Tester features can be further expanded by applying the indicator to another indicator, e.g. RSI. In order to access the tester, press &#8220;T&#8221; (Tester). In order to select a strategy, hover the mouse pointer on the strategy information line. A brief description of the strategy is displayed in the popup menu. You can switch between channel and non-channel strategies by pressing on &#8220;C&#8221; (Channel). Further we plan to add a simple visual strategy constructor, which allows to create custom strategies straight from the indicator window.</p>
<p>Another notable feature is the ability to configure parameters from the indicator window using the key and the mouse. This method is more intuitive, fast and easy. Press &#8220;H&#8221; (Help) for hot key tips, as well as watch the attached video.</p>
<p>Language support has been added (8 languages), to be improved and expanded further. You can select a language from the properties window or by pressing &#8220;L&#8221; (Language).</p>
<p>### Indicator lines</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yellow lines &#8211; redrawn with every tick of the polynomial channel. Green dashed lines &#8211; the polynomial extrapolation into the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-color lines &#8211; non-redrawing channel, traces of a yellow polynomial Yellow. The line is blue when the polynomial lines are directed upwards, purple &#8211; when downwards.</li>
<li>Red line &#8211; Sell, blue line &#8211; Buy. Displayed when the Tester is switched on.</li>
