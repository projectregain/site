Rent Price :<br />
Version : 1.2<br />

<p>Did you ever encounter a problem that your terminal failed to reestablish a connection and caused your EA to stop working? How much money did you lose because you were not aware of the connection error? Worry no more, I am here to present you a solution for your nightmare.</p>
<p>This utility indicator sends a real time push notification or email when your terminal encounters a connection failure. You will be notified <strong>immediately</strong> even if your terminal is yet to establish a success connection to your broker.</p>
<p>Please be reminded if your computer or VPS loses its internet connection, then it will be impossible to alert you until your internet connection is resumed.</p>
<p>### Setup Instruction</p>
<p>This utility indicator requires <strong>at least 2 terminals</strong> to work. To begin, put one copy of the indicator in a chart for each terminal. Once a connection failure occurs in one of the terminal, the other terminals that still connected to its broker will detect the failure and send you an alert immediately.</p>
<p>For example, you have 3 terminals in your VPS. If terminal A fails to connect to its broker&#8217;s server, either terminal B or terminal C will notify you that terminal A has a connection problem. There is no master or slave setting because they are designed to monitor each others.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to have a different broker for each terminal so that they will not lose connection together.</p>
<p><strong>Indicator Setting (Screenshot 1)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>*Detection interval &#8211; *</em>Set how frequent (second) do you want to detect the connection status.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connection Failure Period &#8211;</strong> Minimum disconnected time (second) to declare as connection failure. An alert will be sent to you instantly if the terminal is still disconnected after this period.<br />
Remark:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum Connection Failure Period for demo version is 3600 sec. You may purchase the <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/22801">paid version</a> to remove this limitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to your terminal as usual and then enter a wrong password at the navigator window to simulate a connection failure error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Terminal Setting (Screenshot 2 &amp; 3)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable push notification and fill in your <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/476">MetaQuotes ID</a> at Tools>&gt;Option>&gt;Notifications.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable email and fill in your mail server info at Tools>&gt;Option>&gt;Email.<br />
<strong>Remark</strong>: Do not enable it if you do not wish to receive an alert via that method.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Please be advised that this utility indicator will not work with the <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/vps">VPS</a> offered by MQL5.com.</p>
