<h1>  TRADING STRATEGY ON THE BASIS OF HEDGING WITH CORRELATION (Made in Germany)</h1>
<p>We have repeatedly encountered various strategies based on hedging, but in practice, in their pure form, they were all doomed to failure. </p>
<p>With high volatility in the Forex market, it is rather difficult to detect such convergence of quotations, and there is no need to search for any patterns in the movement of two or more currency pairs at the same time.</p>
<p>That is why we decided to create our own automated trading tactics, which will include both elements of hedging and pair trading, using a grid algorithm, and a secure system with a high level of deposit protection. (All additional orders are opened with a fixed same lot size , without using lot multiplication (Martingale)).</p>
<p>If the price starts to go against the order, the adviser will begin to open additional orders according to the author&#8217;s algorithm, up to a maximum of 5 orders for each instrument in the pair.</p>
<p>The created system was tested on a real account, so you will not only be able to get acquainted with the strategies themselves, but also to see its effectiveness of using them on a real account.</p>
<p>The adviser implements the classic pair correlation scheme, which allows an expert to earn about up to 25% per month with a minimum deposit draw-down.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to have several advisers and several strategies. Our adviser includes several strategies and you can choose for yourself, the strategy that suits you best.</p>
<p>List of strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Twix</strong>: Trade is conducted in two pairs. (<strong>Low Risk, Minimal Balance</strong> up 500$)</p>
<p><strong>Quattro Twix</strong>: Trading in eight pairs. (<strong>Low Risk, Minimal Balance</strong> up 3000$)</p>
<p><strong>Ventiquattro Twix</strong>: Trading twenty four pairs. (<em>*Low Risk, Minimal Balance *</em>up 5000$)</p>

<p>### <strong>TRADING STRATEGY ON THE BASIS OF HEDGING WITH CORRELATION (Made in Germany)</strong></p>
<p>Please do not try to test the Adviser in MT4 strategy tester. It is not possible, because it is multi-currency EA.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly encountered various strategies based on hedging, but in practice, in their pure form, they were all doomed to failure. </p>
<p>With high volatility in the Forex market, it is rather difficult to detect such convergence of quotations, and there is no need to search for any patterns in the movement of two or more currency pairs at the same time.</p>
<p>That is why we decided to create our own automated trading tactics, which will include both elements of hedging and pair trading, using a grid algorithm, and a secure system with a high level of deposit protection. (All additional orders are opened with a fixed same lot size , without using lot multiplication (Martingale)).</p>
<p>If the price starts to go against the order, the adviser will begin to open additional orders according to the author&#8217;s algorithm, up to a maximum of 5 orders for each instrument in the pair.</p>
<p>The created system was tested on a real account, so you will not only be able to get acquainted with the strategies themselves, but also to see its effectiveness of using them on a real account.</p>
<p>The adviser implements the classic pair correlation scheme, which allows an expert to earn about up to 25% per month with a minimum deposit draw-down.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to have several advisers and several strategies. Our adviser includes several strategies and you can choose for yourself, the strategy that suits you best.</p>
<p>List of strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Twix</strong>: Trade is conducted in two pairs. (<strong>Low Risk, Minimal Balance</strong> up 500$)</p>
<p><strong>Quattro Twix</strong>: Trading in eight pairs. (<strong>Low Risk, Minimal Balance</strong> up 3000$)</p>
<p><strong>Ventiquattro Twix</strong>: Trading twenty four pairs. (<em>*Low Risk, Minimal Balance *</em>up 5000$)</p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong>: This type of advisor is not possible to check in the strategy tester since the &#8220;Buy &amp; Hedge&#8221; system uses many currency pairs at the same time and it is impossible to check it in the tester. Since the strategy tester MT4 does not allow from the technical side to test many currency pairs at the same time. If you put the &#8220;Buy &amp; Hedge&#8221; system in the tester, you will see just a fake bot job, a fake job for the tester and the real &#8220;Buy &amp; Hedge&#8221; algorithm have nothing in common. This is done so that &#8220;Buy &amp; Hedge&#8221; could get into the MQL5 market.</p>
<p>The expert for MT5 market is in beta testing. Soon I will announce the final version. With the release of the final version I will set a live signal of the work of the &#8220;Buy &amp; Hedge&#8221; expert.</p>
<p>###  <strong>STRATEGY RESULTS Real Live Account:</strong></p>

<p>On our public signal leverage is 1:100, as some clients want to have European accounts with a restriction on leverage. Our EA works also very well with leverage 1:50. </p>
