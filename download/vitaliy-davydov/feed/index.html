<p><strong>SafeMartin_VS_lite</strong> &#8211; the automatic trading system is optimized for EURUSD H4, but can work also at other currency pairs and timeframes. The adviser has a minimum of settings that allows to put him in work, without the long procedure of selection of optimum parameters at once. Work of several advisers in one terminal is allowed. It works as with 4 as 5 digit  quotes.</p>
<p>The opening of warrants is carried out by the neural network using as entrance signals of the value of the Stochastic indicator. The neural network uses the reinforcement learning method therefore preliminary training in a tester of strategy is not obligatory though it is possible. For storing the current state of the neural network at shutdown, change of settings of the adviser, transfer on other terminals, all data automatically remain in the file.</p>
<p>For the safety of open positions are followed by a grid of warrants which can be disconnected in settings. There is an algorithm for calculating the step of opening orders of grid at large price gaps and big jumps of the price. The trading is allowed in both directions (Buy, Sell). Manual intervention is supported (closing of warrants manually if necessary). At this Take Profit of the remained warrants correctly are recalculated, the logic of work of opening of the subsequent orders is not broken.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Settings of the adviser:</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>GENERAL SETTINGS</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Slipping &#8211; *</em></strong>Is the size of slipping<em>* ;</em>**</p>
<p><strong><em>Method of calculating the next lot</em><em></strong> &#8211; is a method of calculation of a lot of the new warrant of a grid. Classic – lot pays off multiplication by the coefficient. Modified – is used the algorithm of calculation of lot considering gaps and big price jumps;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>From which the warrant of grid to start multiplying lots *</em></strong>– from what warrant of grid begins multiplication of lot by coefficient – with the first or with the second;*</p>
<p><strong><em>SETTINGS OF NEURAL NETWORK</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>neural network training ON/OFF</em><em></strong> &#8211;  is the training of a neuron on / off;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>SETTINGS OF BUY</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Lot size BUY</em><em></strong> &#8211; is the size of the lot of the first BUY order;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>The step between grid orders</em><em></strong> &#8211; is the size of a step of the price of the opening of new buy order;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic number of BUY</em><em></strong> – magic number of orders for BUY;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Maximum count the orders of grid *</em></strong>&#8211; is the count of grid buy orders. At shutdown of martingale (zero value of the parameter), for the first order Stop Loss at the distance equal to the Step between grid orders parameter is automatically exposed.*</p>
<p><strong><em>SETTINGS OF SELL</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Lot size SELL</em><em></strong> &#8211;  is the size of the lot of the first SELL order;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>The step between grid orders</em><em></strong> &#8211; is the size of a step of the price of the opening of new sell order;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic number of SELL *</em></strong>&#8211; magic number of orders for SELL;*</p>
<p><strong><em>Maximum count the orders of grid *</em></strong>&#8211; is the count of grid sell orders. At shutdown of martingale (zero value of the parameter), for the first order Stop Loss at the distance equal to the Step between grid orders parameter is automatically exposed.*</p>
<p>Take Profit computed off and exposed automatically.</p>
<p>For safe trade work on cent accounts, the minimum deposit of $1000 is recommended</p>
