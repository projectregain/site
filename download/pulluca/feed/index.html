<p>### Revolutionary hybrid grid: more than 13 years backtest with starting balance as low as 100 dollars &#8211; VERY IMPORTANT TO BACKTEST DEMO: please read backtest instruction or ask via PM.</p>
<p>### <strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>HIBgRID</em></strong> is a Hybrid Grid EA based on the mean-reverting characteristics of the pair GBP/CAD during low volatility and low volume period.</p>
<p>The EA utilizes the mathematical principles of a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process">Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process</a></strong> to identify trades with success probability higher than 85%.</p>
<p>After a trade is opened the EA will calculate a target profit and close the trade.</p>
<p>In case the price behaviour is unfavorable the Risk Manager will close the trade at a lower profit target or even with a small loss.</p>
<p>If the Risk Manager does not identify evidences of a non mean-reverting time serie the EA will open recovery orders up to a maximum of 5 open orders.</p>
<p>The EA utilizes a proprietary grid logic with light lot size increments in order to minimize drawdown and risk exposure.</p>
<p>### <br />
Live performace results differ may from backtest because</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Signal is stopped during major BREXIT news (precaution)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Signal uses news filter (not working in backtest)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Signal uses 3 days swap fileter</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; A tick system on live account will never match exactly backtest although 99.9%</strong></p>
<p>### For more info on EA and parameters visit <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/725139" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs">https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/725139</a></p>
<h3>**</h3>
<p>What is a Hybrid Grid:**</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As opposed to stabdard grid the EA closes some trades with a loss under certain higher risk conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>Grid orders can be closed with a TP and reopened </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Requirements:</strong></h3>
<p>The minimum investment is 100 Dollars with Very High Risk. 300 dollars for standard settings.</p>
<p><strong>It is STRICTLY MANDATORY to use a true ECN account with low spread on GBPCAD during early Sydney session. IC Market is used as a reference for backtest. See blog for more info</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Parameters:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Standard setting for GBPCAD 1M</h3>
<h3>Broker GMT offset: 0. Leave 0 for NY close broker GMT + 2 or + 3 during DLS (ICMarkets, Axitrader, Darwinex etc)</h3>
<h3><strong>Lot size:</strong> Standard settings 0.03.</h3>
<p><strong>For balance:</strong> Standard settings: 1000. Balance used to calculate lot size.   </p>
<p><strong>Max allowed Draw Down</strong> Standard settings -0.25 as a factor of the current balance. In case the equity drops below this threshold the EA will close all orders as a capital protection measure. As en example, balance is 10.000, Max allowed draw down is -0.2, this means that if the equity goes below 8.000 the EA will close all open orders. VERY IMPORTANT: respect the standard ratio Lot/MaxDD: If your want to set your max risk at 10%, then use 0.01 lot per 1000 and max draw down -0.1. </p>
<p><strong>3 days swap/rollover filter</strong> It is recommended not to trade against the three days rollover (usually between Wednesday and Thursday night for the majority of brokers).</p>
<p>###  <strong>Backtest:</strong></p>
<p>As the spread plays an essential role in the real performance and it is used also as a volatility filter especially before rollover/swap charge and during strong price movement, only a tick by tick, 99% accuracy variable spread test has a statistical meaning. Please avoid testing with fixed spread as it is worthless.</p>
<p>My backtests use Dukascopy data with a negative cap of 27 points and minimum of 12 points, 7 dollars round trip and real swap. This is the closer to the best ECN broker real conditions. Dukascopy spreads are too large for this strategy</p>
<p>###  <strong>Money Management and risk warning:</strong></p>
<p>This EA is suitable for patience and non greedy investors capable to deal with potentially large drawdowns.</p>
<p>Although the backtest surpassed 13 years without a major loss (99% accuracy, variable spread, 7 Dollars round trip commission and current swap), like any grid system the EA can and <strong>WILL FAIL</strong>, therefore the standard capital protection settings will close all orders when the Drawdown exceeds the 25% of the balance. This can be customized in accordance with the risk acceptance of the investor. In case of a 20% loss the EA is designed to recover in less than 300 days unless a second loss occurs before the recovery is completed. </p>
<p><strong>Do not use demo or cent account as they are meaningless for this type of trading.</strong></p>
