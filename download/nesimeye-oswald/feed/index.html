<p><strong>Pivots Dashboard</strong> is the single most complete instruments set for Pivot Points trading currently available in the market. We have done a comprehensive research prior to the product design to make sure that this product meets every need of Pivot Point trading.</p>
<p>Pivots Points are significant levels technical analysts can use to determine directional movement and potential support/resistance levels. Pivot Points are thus predictive or leading indicators. While the points were originally used by floor traders to set key levels to watch during the day, technical analysts have expanded upon the concepts to develop at least five <strong>(Standard, Camarilla, Woodie, Fibonacci, DeMark)</strong> different types of pivot points used in the modern day.</p>
<p>### Features of Pivots Dashboard</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>*Pivot Level BreakOut Alert : *</em>The indicator notifies you when there is a breakout on any pivot level by x-pips (customizable).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>*The five (5) major Pivot Systems: *</em>This dashboard features the five major Pivot Point Systems which are Standard Pivot, Camarilla, Woodie, Fibonacci and DeMark.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Currency:</strong> The dashboard shows Pivot Statistics for all currency symbols in the Market Watch window.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Timeframe:</strong> Pivots Dashboard has four (4) major timeframes including a user defined custom timeframe. The timeframes available include Daily, Weekly, Monthly and a user defined custom timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Trend Detection:</strong> The Dashboard displays the current market trend using an advanced Pivot Strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Scrollbar:</strong> The Dashboard has an in-built scrollbar for easy view.</li>
<li><strong>Window Resize:</strong> The Dashboard allows window resize for convenience and easy view.</li>
<li><strong>Chart Display and Update:</strong> On the click of any currency line on the dashboard, the chart of the pair is opened and the Pivot Lines are displayed on the chart. The pivots for every opened chart are auto-updated.</li>
<li><strong>Novice and Pro compatibility:</strong> We have designed this product to be both easily usable by novice yet extensive for professionals. So, if you are a novice and do not want to concern yourself with Pivot Point technicalities, then just switch to Novice mode. If you are a professional and want to extensively define your pivot point levels, then just switch to Professional mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Pivot Points</h3>
<p>Pivot Points can be used as a primary support and resistance level, thus making it a good spot to set your stop loss and take profits. Pivot Point levels along with other indicators can be used for trend detection and confirmation. As a rule of thumb, if the current price is above the Primary Pivot (PP), then the trend is bullish, and if the price is below the Primary Pivot, then the trend is bearish.</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pivot_display_mode (Novice/ Professional):</strong> Dropdown menu to select the mode of pivot point display on the chart</p>

<p><strong>Version 1.6 !</strong></p>
<p>Volume Strength 28 is better , easier to use and more awesome ! Based on complaint we got from the reviews, we understood many don&#8217;t know how to really use the time frame setting on the input menu thus they have complaints of volatility, thus we have designed an Automatic Time Frame selection system that is suitable for novice traders.! The design of the indicator has been changed along with some calculation metrics. Based on complaints of high volatility we have been getting ,we have designed this version around a stable market system with the ability to spot early trends and exit trends early. In addition to the trend line display, there is an easy view histogram display that is selectable so you can choose the display you want!</p>
<p>Volume always precedes price. Supply and Demand in forex is best defined by trade volumes and trends are formed by supply and demand. Thus if you want to see the move before it happens, take your eyes from the price and look at the volume. Volume Strength 28 is a currency meter that is different from any you’ve come across. Typical currency meters found in the forex markets/community uses price as bases of their analysis however this currency meter uses volume as the bases of its analysis.</p>
<p>Volume strength 28 analyses the trade volume of 28 currency pairs and defines the strength of a currency based on volume. With this logic you can easily spot both micro and macro moves in a currency pair even before they happen.</p>

<p><strong>What Is the newly added “Impulse Meter” about?</strong> </p>
<p>If you are familiar with a catapult, you will understand that the amount of tension in the sling will determine how far your stone will go. Just like a catapult, the Impulse Meter measures the probability of a candle to move in one direction. It uses advanced volume and momentum calculations to achieve this. </p>
<p><strong>*Impulse Probabilities *</strong></p>
<p><strong>*85% &#8211; 100 % &gt; Strong Bullish impulse *</strong></p>
<p><strong>*42% &#8211; 57% &gt; Average Impulse *</strong></p>

<p><strong>More About Advanced Currency Meter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>*</p>
<p>Every good forex system has the following basic components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to recognize the trend direction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to identify the strength of the trend and answer the basic question</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the market trending or is it in a range?</li>
<li>Ability to identify safe entry points that will give a perfect risk to reward (RR) ratio on every position.<br />
How Advanced Currency Meter Helps you Achieve These Components</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced Currency Meter is a tool that measures the strength between individual currencies in a pair. Advanced Currency Meter goes further in employing Moving Average and ADX indicators to confirm the strength of a pair, identify the trend and identify the stage of the trend.</p>
<p><em>*INTRODUCING : <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/18412#" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/18412#">Multi-TimeFrame Currency Meter</a>. *</em>It is an upgraded version of Advanced Currency Meter.

<h3>What is the direction of the trend</h3>
<p>With Advanced Currency Meter, you can easily view the direction of the trend for all currency pairs in one window. It has two basic panels: one of the panels contains the strength of different currencies and the other shows the trend and strength of the currency pairs. When ever the arrow is UP, this is an indication of buy trend and when ever the arrow is DOWN, this is an indication of a down trend.</p>
<h3>What is the strength of the trend</h3>
<p>With Advanced Currency Meter, you can easily ascertain the strength of a trend even if you are a novice. When ever a currency pair is trending, an arrow is displayed to indicate the trend direction. When ever a currency is in a range, the arrow is deleted to indicate that there is no direction.</p>
<h3>Where do i enter the trend to have a good Risk Reward Ratio</h3>
<p>With Advanced Currency Meter, you can easily ascertain the best entry points in a trend. Whenever the difference in strength (off-set) between two currencies in a pair is greater than 4.0, this is strong indication to enter the trend. At this stage the market is likely to move in only one direction for a while thus this a strong indicator for entry points</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>One good attribute of the Advanced Currency Meter is its simple view. No complicated trend lines, channels, arrows etc&#8230; Just numbers that even a 10 year old can read.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
