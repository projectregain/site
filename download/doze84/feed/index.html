								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code><br />
Author : Cristian Eriksson<br />
Category : Experts<br />
Last Update : 12 February 2019<br />
Rent Price : 899 USD<br />
Version : 2.8<br />
</code></p>
<p>Note: Backtesting is by default off, and needs to be turned on for the EA to work properly. This goes for testing the EA in strategy tester as well.  </p>
<p><strong>Sixteen months</strong> after the first Swiss Army Scalper was released, there is now finally a self optimizing version. There have been hundreds of hours building different self testing functions and experimenting with different ways of filtering the market. While some of them are still in the lab, and I have some great ideas going on, this version is a first implementation of a new approach and self optimization combined. It&#8217;s simple, yet intuitive and I couldn&#8217;t have built it without all the trial and error of the last two years.   </p>
<p>Swiss Army Scalper trades on overbought and oversold areas that the tester deems to be statistically favorable. This version can be run on any currency and any time-frame, though you&#8217;ll soon find some to work better than others.  </p>
<p>Up until now it&#8217;s been tested for one month on live account, but I can&#8217;t guarantee there are no bugs. So be cautious. And report any deviating behavior.  </p>
<p>All orders are placed with a stop-loss, and can be set with strict risk-control.  </p>
<p>### Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can start with as little as $100 in your account (that will imply a little higher risk).</p>
<ul>
<li>No martingale, averaging or other potentially account-crashing approaches, just pure strategy.</li>
<li>Uses tight real server side stop-loss at order-placing.</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of work has been put in to get the built in back tester to match reality as accurate as possible.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low spread broker or VPS isn&#8217;t crucial any more, but beneficial.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will not cause any serious damage if computer is turned off, but it will need to be connected to take profit.</p>
</li>
<li>No fast computer or low latency, just a working internet connection.</li>
<li>Great measures to prevent over-fitting in the self tester have been taken.  </li>
</ul>
