<p>&#8220;DigiPipsFX Tiger Jump&#8221; is a Multi Time Frame indicator which helps you to boost you profits. As shown, you can add this multi time frame indicator to you H1 chart (or any other time frames as you wish) and detect the proper time for entry. Default settings are recommended. When all time frames show same direction of the trend, you can take your Buy or Sell positions. While the main time frame (H1) or middle time frame (H4) changes direction, you can exit and wait for a new setup. If there is any questions, please do not hesitate to send me a direct message.</p>

<h1> Mantra Pro EA</h1>
<pre><code>**Mantra Expert Advisor (Lite &amp; Pro Versions) has been designed and programmed based on the market chaos theory and the unpredictability of the market.**
</code></pre>
<p>Although the market is always changing its direction based on fundamental or any other reasons, Mantra EA is still capable to scalp and gain small but continues profits.</p>
<p>A very smart algorithm has been used in Mantra EA which allows it to recover its losses which may occur frequently. It should be noted that a hidden and tight stop loss value has been set in the EA and if it gets triggered, the EA starts to open new positions to recover previous losses until it reaches to the predefined profit value. Based on the logic and the back tests results of this EA which have shown the best and the most reliable settings, none of these values (SL and TP) can be changed by users. </p>
<p>Also, Mantra EA has a built-in settings which makes it independent from time frames. So, you can run it on any time frame that you like. But please note that it works on pairs with spread of less than 10 points (1 Pip).</p>
<p><em>* IMPORTANT NOTE:</em>*</p>
<p><strong>* According to the tight settings of SL and TP in the body of Mantra EA (both hidden), this Expert Advisor MUST be used on pairs with the maximum spread of 2 to 10 points. Therefore, use it on ZERO accounts or some other similar accounts with low spread.*</strong></p>
<p>Since, on Friday nights and on Monday mornings (when the market reach to the end or is going to open) spreads get wide, special settings has been considered to not allow the EA to open new positions on Fridays after a specific time and on Mondays before a specific time in order to get sure that the spreads are in normal conditions. For the same reason, the same settings has been considered to limit the opening of new positions during the roll over time (When the New York Market closes and the Sydney Market opens) during the week days. You can change these settings based on your own knowledge or experience with your broker and your MT4 server time.</p>
<p><strong>This is Mantra Pro Version. For Mantra Lite Version, visit the link: <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/41029" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/41029">https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/41029</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Please also don&#8217;t forget to check the blog: <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/728807" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/728807">https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/728807</a></strong></p>
<pre><code>**MANTRA EXPERT ADVISOR Risk Disclaimer**
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Please note that historical performance of a currency trading system or strategy cannot be indicative of future results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Currency trading offers amazing profit potential, but includes also large risk potential. Therefore, currency trading on margin may not be suitable for all individuals. The high leverage offered in the currency market can work against you as well as for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before you get started with trading in the foreign exchange market with MANTRA EA (Lite or Pro Versions), and indeed, any other Expert Advisors, you should consider your investment goals, objectives, trading experience and your personal risk appetite. You should be also aware of the existing possibility that you could lose some or, in the worst case, all of your initial investment. For this reason, currency trading should only be undertaken with risk capital. The definition of risk capital is the funds that are not necessary to the survival or well being of the user. Make yourself aware of all possibly risks associated with trading currencies on margin. If you have any doubts or concerns you should seek advice form an independent financial advisor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By using MANTRA EA (Lite or Pro Versions), you agree to hold the publisher (seller) and everybody who is involved in the production, development, distribution of MANTRA Expert Advisor free of any responsibility. Any live trading you do, you are doing at your own discretion and risk.</strong></p>
