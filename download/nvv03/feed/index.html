Last Update : 11 January 2019<br />
Rent Price : 39 USD<br />
Version : 1.3<br />
</code></p>
<p>Ready-made trading system with a minimum of settings. <br />
The EA should add to the M5 schedules the main currency pairs with low spreads (0.8-1.2): <br />
EURUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NSDUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD. <br />
In the process of work, the adviser monitors the appearance of a certain pin bar and then, under suitable conditions, also calculated by its algorithm, opens the corresponding order. The TP and SL levels are determined when the order is opened. Tracking the conditions for entry is carried out from 03:00 to 23:59 by the time of the terminal. <br />
The testing of the EA on the currency pairs used was made in the period 01/01/2018 &#8211; 25/08/2018. Test mode &#8211; on each tick. Its results are presented on the attached screenshots. <br />
Due to the large ratio of the deposit to the starting lot size, the stability of the system is achieved, and its profitability is ensured by the trade of the adviser simultaneously for all the above mentioned trading instruments, as the profit for each currency pair is separately summed as a result in total profit.</p>
<p>### Options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>lot Init</strong> &#8211; starting lot size;</li>
<li><strong>Magic Number</strong> &#8211; the identifier of orders;</li>
<li><strong>Lot Multiplier</strong> &#8211; multiplier lot;</li>
<li><strong>Max DD,%</strong> &#8211; the maximum drawdown on the current trading instrument, if the value exceeds the value of the next order in the series does not open, but opens with the starting lot size and already when the new condition for the entry comes:</li>
<li><strong>N ord</strong> &#8211; the maximum number of orders in the series for a particular currency pair.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>*AddPoints *</em>&#8211; additional points for which the SL of the next order is increased;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>*UseVirtualTPSL *</em>&#8211; use virtual TP &amp; SL;</li>
<li><em>*TimeStart *</em>&#8211; the beginning of the time period allowed for opening orders;</li>
<li><strong>TimeStop</strong> &#8211; the end of the time period allowed for opening orders;</li>
<li><em>*ShowTradeComment *</em>&#8211; display of the general information panel on the chart;</li>
<li><em>*HeaderColor *</em>&#8211; header background color;</li>
<li><em>*BGColor *</em>&#8211; the color of the main background.<br />

<p>I bring to your attention an auxiliary EA for the MetaTrader 4 trading platform, with the help of which the trader can open orders and withdraw open positions to profit by automatically opening market order grid by the EA in accordance with the settings.</p>
<p>Trading with the help of an EA: <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/630363" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/628357">https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/630363</a>.</p>
<p>Functions:</p>
<pre><code>* manual opening of any types of orders;
</code></pre>
<p>* automatic opening of market orders in accordance with the settings;<br />
 * the ability to set a lot multiplier for open orders;<br />
 * showing the general trading information panel;<br />
 * display of previously closed orders on the chart;<br />
 * installation on a chart of price signal lines;<br />
 * sending push-notifications when price crosses price signal lines;<br />
 * the ability to use the EA to trade with brokers operating under the FIFO rule;<br />
 * sound orders with the help of four built-in sound schemes, or user sound files;<br />
 * separate closing orders.<br />
    It is also very convenient for the EA to simply use it to control the closing of orders &#8211; with the automatic opening of orders disabled. Now you no longer need to manually drag the TP and SL levels and try to set them to the desired number of points from the opening price. Just enter the required number of points (and / or profit / loss) in the appropriate fields and the adviser will do everything automatically for you!</p>
<p>The control panel can be customized in appearance. Changes in the settings are applied when a first or new addition of the EA to the chart.</p>
<p>Since there is no manual opening of orders in the terminal strategy tester, you can try a free demo version working on the CADCHF currency pair (without prefixes in the symbol name) to test the EA’s work: <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/40584" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/39958">Market Grid Maker Demo</a>.</p>
