<p>Support and Resistance are the important price levels to watch out during intraday market. These price levels are often tested before development of new trend or often stop the existing trend causing trend reversal at this point. Highly precise support and resistance are indispensable for experienced traders. Many typical trading strategies like breakout or trend reversal can be played well around these support and resistance levels. The Precision Support and Resistance are highly accurate support and resistance tools designed for serious traders. In addition to accurate support and resistance level detection, the Precision Support and Resistance provides additional four features to aid your winning trading. They include decision candle detection, Intra Candle Probability Calculation, Pivot Analysis and Ladder Analysis. Any of these features can be switched on and off for your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>1. Support and Resistance</strong></p>
<p>We use the density and geometry approach to compute support and resistance levels. Quite often you will observe that detected support and resistance levels predict very accurately where price penetrate hard or where price reverse back hard. According to you preference, some sensible trading strategy can be developed.</p>
<p><strong>2. Decision Candle Detection</strong></p>
<p>Decision candle detection module alerts traders the possible big movement. Decision candle is the typical pattern appearing before onset of the strong reversal or strong continuation of the current trend. Therefore, it is recommended to watch out the appearance of this decision candle in your trading especially if they are around important support and resistance level.</p>
<p><strong>3. Intra-Candle Probability Calculation</strong></p>
<p>Intra-Candle probability is the statistical prediction of future range of close price for projected horizon. This tool will display 1%, 5%, 10%, 32%, 50%, 80% levels. The pair of lines will be drawn above and below the open price of the current candle. 50% probability means that the chance of the close price being outside this lines is the 50% from open price of the candle. Instead of doing some guess work, you can precisely estimate when the price will touch support and resistance level or when the price will touch moving average line or when the price will touch Bollinger band lines, etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. Pivot Analysis</strong></p>
<p>We added the standard pivot analysis technique. Pivot analysis can be used in two purposes. First, you can use pivot level to double confirm support and resistance levels. Second, you can use pivot level to confirm rough trend if that is your interest. For example, if price closed below S1 or S2 yesterday, then you can say that current trend is downmarket. The built in Pivot analysis provide daily pivot only and you can choose how many number of days you want to display the pivot levels.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ladder Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Simply speaking ladder analysis will answer the question like what is the probability of the close price will stay outside the specified level of your interest. For example, you believe that the level 1.2400 is important and you want to find out what is the chance of the close price will actually end above this important level. Then you can use this Ladder Analysis to find the probability.  </p>
<p><strong>Input Setting</strong></p>
<p>Default setting works well for most of currency pairs and timeframes. Changing input parameters are extremely simple and self explanatory as usual. Most of time you will use default settings.  </p>
<p><em>* *</em>  <strong>How to Use</strong></p>
<p>You can use this Precision Support Resistance alone to perform breakout trading strategy or trend reversal trading strategy. This tool can be applied to any timeframe with varying performance level. Additionally, you can use following products to yield excellent trading performance, too. However, adding these tools are optional. You must do so only after you are familiar with Precision Support Resistance tool.</p>

<p>### Introduction to Smart Renko</p>
<p>The main characteristics of Renko Charting concern price movement. To give you some idea on its working principle, Renko chart is constructed by placing a brick over or below when the price make the movement beyond a predefined range, called brick height. Therefore, naturally one can see clear price movement with less noise than other charting type. Renko charting can provide much clearer trend direction and it helps to identify important support and resistance level more clearly. As Renko charting does not use time, original Renko charting have some difficulties to be used together with other technical indicators. Especially backtesting of your strategy using typical Renko charting is very difficult and time consuming. However, we brought Smart Renko Chart here. Smart Renko overcomes the limitation of traditional Renko charting and it brings you many other benefits for your efficient trading.</p>
<p>### Main Features of Smart Renko</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use any timeframe to calculate your Renko bricks including M1 and M5.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Renko will show you generally agreeable trend movement towards all timeframe.</li>
<li>You can display spread view of Renko bricks on your main chart allowing you to backtest with other technical indicators.</li>
<li>You can cross reference between the Renko bricks on your main chart and Renko bricks on your indicator chart. (Simply just double click on your main chart or indicator chart. You will see reference lines on both charts.)</li>
<li>Smart Renko includes automatic brick height calculation using Standard Deviation and Z value. Therefore even a starter can use this Smart Renko Indicator.</li>
<li>Smart Renko will indicate the future brick level for buy and sell bricks in advance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Note on Smart Renko</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart Renko must be used together with other indicator. You can use it with many built-in technical indicators successfully, such as MACD, RSI or Stoch, Moving Average to construct your trading strategy.</p>

This indicator can help you identify important support and resistance lines quite clearly comparing to traditional charting techniques like candlestick or range bars, etc. With traditional Renko chart, traders tend to create all sorts of indicators in the separate indicator charts. No need to do such hard work any more. Just use spread view of bricks on your main window and use all the MetaTrader standard indicators to create or to refine your trading strategy. Renko Chart’s main working principle is based on price action. Therefore, this indicator benefits many price action trading strategies.

<p>### Introduction</p>
<p>Harmonic Volatility Indicator is the first technical analysis applying the Fibonacci analysis to the financial volatility. Harmonic volatility indicator is another level of price action trading tool which combines robust Fibonacci ratios (0.618, 0.382, etc.) with trading volatility. Originally, Harmonic Volatility Indicator was developed to overcome the limitation and the weakness of Gann’s Angle, also known as Gann’s Fan. We have demonstrated that Harmonic Volatility Indicator can be applied in a similar manner to Gann’s Angle (or Gann’s Fan) to your chart. At the same time, since the volatility is very important information for traders, Harmonic Volatility Indicator can bring many other benefits to traders, too. Harmonic Volatility Indicator can be well incorporated to your existing technical analysis or you can use it as totally standalone technical analysis for your trading. It is also very effective in spotting mature trend in its end phase. You can use this tool to identify the significant support/resistance levels, trend reversal point and trend strength.</p>
<p>### Possible Trading Setup and Strategies</p>
<p>As long as you understand the basic trading principle, you can always expand your trading with different ideas using Harmonic Volatility Indicator. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Equilibrium Fractal Wave Analytics</strong></p>
<p>EFW Analytics was designed to accomplish the statement &#8220;We trade because there are regularities in the financial market&#8221;. EFW Analytics is a set of tools designed to maximize your trading performance by capturing the repeating fractal geometry, known as the fifth regularity in the financial market. The functionality of EFW Analytics consists of three parts including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equilibrium Fractal Wave Index: exploratory tool to support your trading logic to choose which ratio to trade</li>
<li>Superimposed Pattern Detection</li>
<li>Equilibrium Fractal Wave (EFW) Channel detection<br />
EFW Analytics provide the graphic rich and fully visual trading decision support. In default trading strategy, you will be looking at the combined signal from Superimpsoed pattern + EFW Channel. In addition, you can perform many more trading straetgies in a reversal and breakout mode. You can also run two different timeframes in one chart to enforce your trading decision. Sound alert, email and push notifiaction are built inside the indicator.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equilibrium Fractal Wave Index</h3>
<p>Equilibrium Fractal Wave index is an exploratory analysis tool for your trading. How to use the EFW index is similar to Hurst Exponent by Harold Edwin Hurst (1880-1978) or Fractal Dimension coined by Mandelbrot in 1975. Literarily, EFW index can help you to confirm the presence of equilibrium fractal waves in the financial market. However, Equilibrium fractal wave index is more practical and intuitive comparing to Hurst Exponent and Fractal Dimension for your trading. The value of equilibrium fractal wave index can range from 0.0 to over 1.0. The higher the equilibrium fractal wave index, you can confirm the stronger presence of a particular shape ratio of equilibrium fractal wave. Hence this ratio will be your choice of trading. If you stronly believe on fibonacci ratios like 0.618, 0.382, etc, then you may skip this part because default ratio setting uses 0.382, 0.500 and 0.618. However, you will find that some fibonacci ratios are not significant for some currency pairs.  </p>
<h3>Superimposed Patterns</h3>
<p>Superimposed patterns are the several triangles overlapping in the same place in your chart. Superimposed pattern can provide the good trading entries when it is used together with EFW channel.  </p>
<h3>Equilibrium Fractal Wave (EFW) Channel</h3>
<p>How to use EFW channel is extremely simple. You can use it for both breakout and reversal with EFW channel. When you trade with reveral trading strategy, you can tune your entry with superimposed pattern together. To manage your risk, you can simply use the proportional trigger method as it shown in the book &#8220;winning financial trading with equilibrium fractal wave&#8221; or &#8220;Financial Trading with Five Regularities of Nature: Scientific Guide to Price Action and Pattern Trading&#8221; (2017, Young Ho Seo).  </p>
<h3>How to Trade</h3>
<p>When you use this tool alone, we recommend the combined signal from superimposed pattern and EFW channel. You can use EFW Analytics with some of our other products. Here is some example of trading signal you can generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superimposed patterns + EFW channel (Default Reversal trading strategy when you are using EFW Analytics alone)</li>
<li>You can also use EFW Channel for breakout trading too. But please use your own setup for this case.</li>
<li>Superimposed patterns + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4858" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4858">Price Breakout Pattern Scanner</a></li>
<li>EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4475" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4475">Harmonic Pattern Plus</a> (or <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/6101" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/6101">Harmonic Pattern Scenario Planner</a>)</li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16823" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16823">Mean Reversion Supply Demand</a></li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16472" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16472">Elliott Wave Trend</a></li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/30621" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/30621">Excessive Momentum Indicator</a>  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Controllable Inputs</h3>
<p>The EFW Analytics has five controllable inputs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common User setting &#8211; common input setting for EFW Analytics</li>
<li>EFW Index setting &#8211; this input controls everything related to EFW index</li>
<li>EFW Channel setting &#8211; this input controls everything related to EFW Channel</li>

<p><strong>Introduction to Equilibrium Fractal Wave Analytics</strong></p>
<p>EFW Analytics was designed to accomplish the statement &#8220;We trade because there are regularities in the financial market&#8221;. EFW Analytics is a set of tools designed to maximize your trading performance by capturing the repeating fractal geometry, known as the fifth regularity in the financial market. The functionality of EFW Analytics consists of three parts including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equilibrium Fractal Wave Index: exploratory tool to support your trading logic to choose which ratio to trade</p>
<ul>
<li>Superimposed Pattern Detection</li>
<li>Equilibrium Fractal Wave (EFW) Channel detection<br />
EFW Analytics provide the graphic rich and fully visual trading decision support. In default trading strategy, you will be looking at the combined signal from Superimpsoed pattern + EFW Channel. In addition, you can perform many more trading straetgies in a reversal and breakout mode. You can also run two different timeframes in one chart to enforce your trading decision. Sound alert, email and push notifiaction are built inside the indicator.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equilibrium Fractal Wave Index</h3>
<p>Equilibrium Fractal Wave index is an exploratory analysis tool for your trading. How to use the EFW index is similar to Hurst Exponent by Harold Edwin Hurst (1880-1978) or Fractal Dimension coined by Mandelbrot in 1975. Literarily, EFW index can help you to confirm the presence of equilibrium fractal waves in the financial market. However, Equilibrium fractal wave index is more practical and intuitive comparing to Hurst Exponent and Fractal Dimension for your trading. The value of equilibrium fractal wave index can range from 0.0 to over 1.0. The higher the equilibrium fractal wave index, you can confirm the stronger presence of a particular shape ratio of equilibrium fractal wave. Hence this ratio will be your choice of trading. If you stronly believe on fibonacci ratios like 0.618, 0.382, etc, then you may skip this part because default ratio setting uses 0.382, 0.500 and 0.618. However, you will find that some fibonacci ratios are not significant for some currency pairs.  </p>
<h3>Superimposed Patterns</h3>
<p>Superimposed patterns are the several triangles overlapping in the same place in your chart. Superimposed pattern can provide the good trading entries when it is used together with EFW channel.  </p>
<h3>Equilibrium Fractal Wave (EFW) Channel</h3>
<p>How to use EFW channel is extremely simple. You can use it for both breakout and reversal with EFW channel. When you trade with reveral trading strategy, you can tune your entry with superimposed pattern together. To manage your risk, you can simply use the proportional trigger method as it shown in the book &#8220;winning financial trading with equilibrium fractal wave&#8221; or &#8220;Financial Trading with Five Regularities of Nature: Scientific Guide to Price Action and Pattern Trading&#8221; (2017, Young Ho Seo).  </p>
<h3>How to Trade</h3>
<p>When you use this tool alone, we recommend the combined signal from superimposed pattern and EFW channel. You can use EFW Analytics with some of our other products. Here is some example of trading signal you can generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superimposed patterns + EFW channel (Default Reversal trading strategy when you are using EFW Analytics alone)</li>
<li>You can also use EFW Channel for breakout trading too. But please use your own setup for this case.</li>
<li>Superimposed patterns + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4859" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4859">Price Breakout Pattern Scanner</a></li>
<li>EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4488" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4488">Harmonic Pattern Plus</a> (or <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/6240" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/6240">Harmonic Pattern Scenario Planner</a>)</li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16851" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16851">Mean Reversion Supply Demand</a></li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16479" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/16479">Elliott Wave Trend</a></li>
<li>Superimposed pattern or EFW channel + <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/30641" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/30641">Excessive Momentum Indicator <br />
</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Controllable Inputs</h3>
<p>The EFW Analytics has five controllable inputs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common User setting &#8211; common input setting for EFW Analytics</li>
<li>EFW Index setting &#8211; this input controls everything related to EFW index</li>
<li>EFW Channel setting &#8211; this input controls everything related to EFW Channel</li>

<p>### Introduction</p>
<p>Harmonic Volatility Indicator is the first technical analysis applying the Fibonacci analysis to the financial volatility. Harmonic volatility indicator is another level of price action trading tool, which combines robust Fibonacci ratios (0.618, 0.382, etc.) with trading volatility. Originally, Harmonic Volatility Indicator was developed to overcome the limitation and the weakness of Gann’s Angle, also known as Gann’s Fan. We have demonstrated that Harmonic Volatility Indicator can be applied in a similar manner to Gann’s Angle (or Gann’s Fan) to your chart. At the same time, since the volatility is very important information for traders, Harmonic Volatility Indicator can bring many other benefits to traders, too. Harmonic Volatility Indicator can be well incorporated to your existing technical analysis or you can use it as totally standalone technical analysis for your trading. It is also very effective in spotting mature trend in its end phase. You can use this tool to identify the significant support resistance levels, trend reversal point and trend strength.</p>
<p>### Possible trading setup and strategies</p>
<p>As long as you understand the basic trading principle, you can always expand your trading with different ideas using Harmonic Volatility Indicator. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possible Trading Setup 1 &#8211; Harmonic Volatility Indicator as zone trading (reversal and breakout trading setup)</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible Trading Setup 2 &#8211; Harmonic Volatility Indicator and common oscillators (reversal trading setup)</li>
<li>Possible Trading Setup 3 &#8211; Harmonic Volatility Indicator and Market Profile (reversal trading styles and possible to trade with breakout mode)</li>
<li>Possible Trading Setup 4 &#8211; Harmonic Volatility Indicator and <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4475" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/4475">Harmonic Pattern Plus</a> and Market Profile (reversal trading setup)</li>
</ul>

<p>EFW Pattern Trader is a Powerful Pattern Scanner for your trading. The main pattern detection methods in this software follows the principle of Equilibrium Fractal Wave (EFW Notation using shape ratio and propagation ratio, original concept created by Young Ho, Seo). Therefore, our EFW Pattern Trader provides an effective pattern detection algorithm. Any patterns in EFW Pattern Trader can be backtested visually in your strategy tester. Visual backtesting with pattern will show you how pattern will likely behave in you live trading. Therefore, you can build full rational and confidence before your trading. Each pattern will generate different performance for different market. Therefore, run each pattern in your strategy tester and then choose which patterns you want to trade for the specific currency pairs to maximize your profit. Of course, you can trade multiple patterns for single currency pairs. You can use sound alert, push notification and email (Push notification is preferred way for remote signal). After backtesting, to synchronize your backtesting results to your live accounts, use EFW Pattern Trader for your live trading only.</p>
<p>### <br />
How to Trade</p>
<p>In general, each detected pattern will show you which direction to trade. Therefore, trading is really simple. Using this software requires at least some knowledge on risk and reward management in the financial trading. Check the performance of each pattern with your own eyes in your MetaTrader strategy tester before buying. Typically the pattern traders uses second confirmation to confirm the trading direction with patterns. The typical second confirmation can include fundametals and other technical indicators.  </p>
<p>For your information, tradable Patterns in EFW Pattern Trader:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>are not repainting</p>
<ul>
<li>are not recalculating</li>
<li>provide stop loss and take profit target for your trading.</li>
</ul>
<h3>List of Tradable Patterns</h3>
<p>All the patterns are powerful here but you might like some patterns more than the others might. Do not forget to backtest each pattern before trading. Backtesting will run faster in smaller timeframe when you use every tick mode. You might use open price mode at your own risk.  </p>
