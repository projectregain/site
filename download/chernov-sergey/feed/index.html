<p>The trading robot opens trades regardless of whether it is a trend or a flat. Trades are opened under the condition of &#8220;breakout&#8221; or &#8220;repulse&#8221; of the price from the support or resistance levels. This robot has fixed Take Profit and floating Stop Loss. Take profit is set immediately at the opening of the transaction, and the Stop Loss is set in it in the main code of the program, but all transactions are necessarily with Take profit and Stop Loss. Stop Loss is removed specifically so that it is not displayed on the broker&#8217;s server, but only the entry and exit by Take Profit are visible. The stop Loss is only marked on your computer by a drawn line where the robot will exit if the price movement is in a negative direction. Another advantage is that this robot can trade quietly on all major pairs <em>(<strong>EUR</strong>USD, <strong>GBP</strong>USD, <strong>AUD</strong>USD, <strong>NZD</strong>USD, USD<strong>JPY</strong>, USD<strong>CHF</strong>, USD<strong>CAD</strong>)</em>, where only the minimum spread, because the take profit of <strong>10 <em>*points *(</strong>100</em>* pips)<em>. Also suitable for trading in addition to the foreign exchange market &#8211; the market shares of all companies where the minimum spread. The robot works only on an hour interval *(recommended timeframe &#8211; <strong>H1</strong>)</em>.   In the main code of the robot made all the settings and you only need to change the terminal, how many decimal places <em>(for the calculation take EURUSD)</em>. Listing price 1,11523 is <strong>5</strong> digits, and quotation of 1.1152 is <strong>4</strong> digits. In the settings you add only zero <strong>&#8220;0&#8221;</strong> and change if you have a <strong>5</strong> digit system of quotations. All other calculations are done by the robot itself <em>(multiplication of transactions, recalculation if negative SWAP, adding positions, Deposit calculation, setting take profit, closing by stop loss, recognition of transactions by a unique number)</em>. In the settings prescribed immediately trading lot/load on the Deposit and depends on the number of pairs, you just choose the trading load. <br />
   The main settings to change and designation:   1. <strong>Magic Number</strong> &#8211; <strong>&#8220;34812&#8221;</strong> is an arbitrary number and the robot recognizes them that this is his deal and he continues to work on the basis of the terms of closing transactions, if you do not want to continue to work as before this robot traded and decided to change the terms of work, then just change any number;   2. <strong>Lots Mod <em>*- Load for Deposit. For a maximum load of 7 pairs requires a Deposit of at least $ 5000 or 5000 cents *($50)</em> and the load on all pairs should be 5000=0.01, if you want to start with a minimum load and profit, the lot size choose 10000=0.01 lot.   3.</strong> Take Profit<em>* &#8211; Basic settings are set for 4-digit platforms, if you have five-digit quotes, then add zero &#8220;0&#8221; to Take-Profit, Swap1 and 2, SL Shift1,2 and 3;   4. <strong>Swap1</strong> &#8211; Transfer of positions with negative Swap, from Monday to Wednesday and from Thursday to Friday <strong>1</strong> point *(10 pips)</em> is added to increase Take Profit;   5. <strong>Swap2</strong> &#8211; Transfer of positions with negative Swap, from Wednesday to Thursday &#8211; added <strong>3</strong> points <em>(30 pips)</em> to increase Take Profit;   6. <strong>SL Shift1</strong> &#8211; Set the first Stop Loss from the previous low in points;   7. <strong>SL Shift2</strong> &#8211; Set the second Stop Loss from the previous low in points;   8. <strong>SL Shift3</strong> &#8211; Set the third Stop Loss from the previous low in points;   9. <strong>Slippage</strong> &#8211; Slippage or price deviation from the entry under the conditions for opening trades <em>(leave unchanged)</em>. <br />
   Colleagues !!!   Testing in the MT4 terminal using the <strong>&#8220;strategy tester&#8221;</strong> does not give a complete picture of how the EA trades. The test runs on one pair and it can not be run on all pairs, when this EA is more suitable for <em>* 7</em>* pairs and in the aggregate brings a good income and a minimum drawdown/load on the Deposit. <br />
<strong><em>I recommend to start by seven couples for real time statistics online.</em></strong>    </p>
