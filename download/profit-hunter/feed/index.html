<p><strong>Market Mechanic</strong> &#8211; an universal automatic analyst-trader, able to find profitable entry points on any charts and trade them.</p>
<p>It is known that the market operates according to its own laws. The chart of each currency pair has its own laws, which are difficult to understand for the uninitiated person. In order to automate the search for these patterns and use obtained results in the trade, <strong>Market Mechanic</strong> was created.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this advisor is that it is absolutely universal and fully optimized, and it depends only on you to what extent its capabilities are used. You can use it on several charts of the same currency pair of different timeframes and with different settings of the input parameters or on several currency pairs. The main thing is correct optimization. You should take the issue of optimization very seriously, because <strong>Market Mechanic</strong> will in any case find the right strategy for the chart of any currency pair and for any timeframe. The default version is optimized for one type of channels on the 1 hour timeframe of the GBPUSD pair, but this is just one of many options and possibilities for you. And even if the current test shows a loss-making trading, it doesn’t say much about the EA, as there are many configuration options, and, trading on several graphs and timeframes, the adviser will statistically make a plus. Your task is to find your options. Note that this is a huge advantage for you as a client. You are not invited to buy incomprehensible .ex4 file. You are offered a designer with universally customizable basic parameters, from which you can independently create one or several adviser options for any currency pair that will shows itself well in tests, and only then buy this product. The main thing is not to forget to save successful sets of settings in set-files and not to confuse them with each other. Each setting should work on a separate chart.</p>
<p>For the first test it is recommended to use this <a href="https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ox9n2P5ySOaHUVJt5qlEd0Za7Ag44gS/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ox9n2P5ySOaHUVJt5qlEd0Za7Ag44gS/view?usp=sharing">set file</a>. You should understand the principle, and then create such files yourself.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t want to search for strategies and optimize? Buy the <strong><a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/35780" title="https://www.mql5.com/ru/market/product/35780">Technical Specialist</a></strong>,<em>* <strong>the version of *</em>Market Mechanic</strong> without the ability to search strategies, but with a ready-made set of working strategies for the GBPUSD currency pair.</p>
<p>I am also ready to share my best practices with clients, and after buying I drop set files with a successful strategy.</p>
<p>At the moment, the EA is able to carry out a deep analysis of charts in the search for accurate entries on the strategy of trade channels. It is able to determine trends by qualitative extremes of the trading periods and only trade in the direction of the trend or against the trend, from critical extremes or both.</p>
