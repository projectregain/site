<p><strong>Multi chart viewer</strong> allows you to simultaneously view up to 25 charts of trading instruments in one window of the main chart . T Which approach may be convenient for the simultaneous viewing of a large number of trading instruments &#8220;on the fly&#8221; , allowing detection ivat correlations between the tools for the analysis of the current situation when making trading decisions. </p>
<p>The program is equipped with various algorithms that help to make an adequate assessment of the current situation. The composition includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ATR calculation algorithm (Average True Range) with advanced functionality that allows you to use arbitrary period and number of bars for calculation, the direction and value of the gap in points are displayed on the top line, below the average value in points, then the current value in points, then ratio of average to current as a percentage; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>automatic construction of Fibo levels depending on the ATR with two level modes (classic and advanced) with the possibility of an audio signal to approach the price to a level; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm for calculating volumes with displaying directly on the chart by coloring the bars in the corresponding color, or marking them with dots, the color legend is set in the settings (VCU, VCD &#8211; high volume and large bar size, HVC &#8211; high volume and small bar size, LV &#8211; low volume ) , has two operating modes &#8220;Tick volumes&#8221; and &#8220;Real volumes&#8221; , there is the possibility of an audible alarm ; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>displays the current time and time until the current bar closes.</p>
<p>At the first launch of the program, the symbols of the trading instruments are selected from the “Market Watch” terminal and automatically assigned to slave charts. </p>
<p>To select the symbol of interest and assign it to the desired schedule, you need to click on the current time display in the lower left corner of the main chart. A list of available symbols previously activated in the “Market Watch” terminal will be opened. Then click on the desired chart and then click on the desired symbol. To exit the symbol assignment operation for charts, you must again click on the current time display in the lower left corner of the main chart , the list of available characters will be hidden. </p>
<p>The symbol of the lower right graph always corresponds to the symbol of the main graph on which the program is installed and you cannot change it from the program. </p>
<p>In the settings, you can select the appropriate mode of operation of all the algorithms used, the menu items are clearly identified.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the more graphs will be displayed at a time, the more power will be required from the computer. Please adequately evaluate the capabilities of your computer.</p>
