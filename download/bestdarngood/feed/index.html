								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code><br />
Author : Benjamin Patri<br />
Category : Experts<br />
Last Update : 10 November 2016<br />
Rent Price :<br />
Version : 1.10<br />
</code></p>
<p>The Automated EA program takes Hedge and Arbitrage trading to a whole new level by trading a basket of three currency pairs at the same time on the same account. The strategy is based on three currency pairs being traded concurrently when their prices are out of sync with each other to earn a profit. The program does not rely on latency between multiple accounts like many Arbitrage strategies. The program is a fully automatic program requiring no user interaction once set up on a chart of choice. The program closes the basket of trades once the Profit Target in Overall Pips is met or when specially designed closing conditions are met.</p>
<p>Note, this free version will only trade 0.01 lot sizes, upgrade to the Paid Version for more flexibility and Adjustable Parameters.</p>
<p>The program is ideal for those looking for a <strong>low risk option</strong> in the market. By having three equal trades open at the same time in both directions for each currency, a user is <strong>better protected by market fluctuations</strong>. Trade open time averages a couple of days with this program rather than seconds like most Arbitrage programs. This is good because the program relies less on latency and execution rate than your typical Arbitrage or Scalper program. It is still recommended to pick a broker with low spreads and fast execution as they will play a role in both number of trades taken and profit earned.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the strategy used to trade where three currency pairs are traded at once, please note that this program <strong>cannot be backtested</strong> using the strategy tester since you can only backtest one pair of data at a time. Backtesting was performed by the author with a self-written program using real tick data for all three default pairs: AUDUSD, EURUSD, and EURAUD. Based on these tests, using the default risk setting of 30, the <strong>expected max drawdown is 6%</strong> with an average monthly return of about 2-3%. A risk setting of 60 will double the <strong>expected max drawdown to 12%</strong> and the average monthly return to 4-6%. All results are based on an account using a leverage of 1:50 and a deposit of $2000. Results may vary based on broker fees and other market conditions.</p>
