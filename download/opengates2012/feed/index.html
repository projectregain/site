<p><strong>MINI FFMV Dashboard</strong> </p>
<p>MINI FFMV Dashboard is a MINIATURE custom indicator of FULL FOREX MARKET-VIEW DASHBOARD created to give the Traders a full view of what is going on in the market. It uses a real time data to access the market and display every bit of information needed to make a successful trading. It shows as many as 30 currency pairs or as allowed to display in the Market Watch of your MT4 </p>
<p><strong>USAGE:</strong> For Solo Trading For Basket Trading (See the screenshot on how) </p>
<p>COMPONENTS: </p>
<p>Trend: Overall trend of the currencies as agreed together from Minute to Monthly </p>
<p>Signal: Suggested action to take on each currency pair due to market&#8217;s current status. </p>
<p>Impacts: The magnitudes of the currencies&#8217; movements and volatility as shown below: </p>
<p>Build-up: The currency is just building up its movements to either buy or sell </p>
<p>Good: The currency is getting serious in its movements and gathering trends in a direction either buy or sell </p>
<p>High: This shows that this currency is to be on our attention as something is happening worth of interest </p>
<p>Strong: The direction is getting hot and giving a reliable signal to be considered </p>
<p>Very strong: This needs to be on our radar for good attentions Excellent: The peak of the signals telling us that we are good to go with one more step -> </p>
<p>Changes: The currency movements has been since the day began either trending or side way, losing or gaining </p>
<p><strong>Rates:</strong> Shows how reliable the currency is to be considered for trading in percentages </p>
<p><strong>Chart:</strong> Gives the name of currency pair that is ready for trade </p>
<p>HOW TO USE THE DASHBOARD: </p>
<p>All Time frames from Minute 1 to Monthly must agree together except the M1 time frame i. e It is either all the arrows are Green for buy signal or Red color arrows for sell trade consideration </p>
<p>Trend must tell us if the trend&#8217;s direction has been established &#8211; Bullish/Bearish </p>
<p>Signal display the type of trade we are to expect to take when ready &#8211; Sell Now or Buy Now </p>
<p>Impact must show EXCELLENT as the best impact to consider </p>
<p>Changes must be positive or at least be from 0.00 upward. Must not be negative EXCEPT all other signals agree together for a direction which means that the currency is in a state of RECOVERY, it may be traded </p>
<p>Rates must be 100% but any currency that rates 60% upward is good enough for a trade Trade is the focus factor, once it gives currency name, then it is ready for further trading consideration </p>
<p><strong>WHAT NEXT?</strong> </p>
<p>After gotten a trade signal from the Dashboard, we must further consider these two factors: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Support and Resistance Levels:</strong> These are powerful levels which determine if a currency&#8217;s movement will continue or reverse because these are the areas of great struggles between the Buyers and Sellers, a battle front where struggles are intense, the party with the most staying power will carry the day If the currency concerned is presently near or at a support or resistance level, draw a line at either the support or resistance level and wait to see if the price will break the level and if it does, that is a breakout, then you are good to go but if it didn&#8217;t and reversed, forget about such currency, go back to the dashboard to consider another currency pair but If the currency is not at any of these levels, then you are good to go instantly. It is also great if the price is starting to buy according to the signal from the exhaustive point of sell trend or buy trend. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forex News:</strong> Forex news must be avoided especially a medium or major impact news on any currency pair. Before entering any trade even after a sure signal from the Dashboard, we must take time to check the News on a Forex News Website. If there is a news on such currency pair, we must drop the currency pair. However, if the news has been released long before you got signal from the Dashboard, that is supposed to be a good trade because it means that the end-resultant effects of the news is working to our favor. </p>
<p>Before you finally open a trade, to avoid retracements at the time you want to open, wait for a flat-headed candle with tail. The candle&#8217;s flat head must be in the direction of your trade, then enter. </p>
<p>Aside these two factors, nothing to fear, go straight and place your trade when you get a sure signal from the Dashboard.</p>
<p>Just be sure all the Dashboard components agree together as instructed here</p>
<p>As you use this indicator, I wish you lorry-load of pips and stress-less trading.</p>
<p>Enjoy your day and&#8230;</p>
<p>Cheers  </p>

<p><strong>HOW TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solo trading:</strong> Mini CSM can be used for solo trading by analyzing the strength of each group of currency. Take for instance: if USD group is having rates less than 30% and EUR Group is having rates greater than 70% or there about, you can just pick <strong>EURUSD</strong> for trading since both of them have the currency concerned in the rating. This means you will BUY EURUSD because EUR is stronger than USD at that moment. EUR is generally strong while USD is generally weak. Placing them together is a good idea of trading to get results. There is a good probability that you will always almost get it right without issues.   </p>
<p>Getting same signal from both CSM and Dashboard gives major reliable signal to trade (see screenshot for example)</p>
<p>Try with demo to practice it. Wishing you stress-less trading.  </p>
<p>Cheers  </p>

<p><strong>Mini Currency Strength Meter</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Mini Currency Strength Meter</strong> is a PORTABLE (mini) currency strength meter created to measure/analyze currency strength and pass the information to the trader through a graphical display of each currency group&#8217;s strength rates by percentage.   </p>
<p><strong>USAGE:</strong> <br />
It is useful in two ways for trading:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Solo Trading  </p>
<p>This means you will BUY EURUSD because EUR is stronger than USD at that moment. EUR is generally strong while USD is generally weak. Placing them together is a good idea of trading to get results. There is a good probability that you will always almost get it right without issues. </p>
<p>Try it with demo and see what I am taking about. It is a simple strategy and it works effectively for the traders using this method for their trading.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What you need next to do when you see a signal like this, check if the currency is in the news especially medium or high impacts news, if it is, then wait till after the news to see what will happen next before taking trade if the signal is still there. But if not, then head over to Minute time frame to see if the price is going according to the signal before entering the trade. Also mind the support and resistance levels if the price is approaching any of them, if it is, wait to see breakout or reversal before deciding what to do next.   </p>
<p><strong>Basket trading:</strong> It can be used for what is called &#8220;Basket trading&#8221;. Basket trading is a group of a currency moving together in unison to the same direction. If the rate is below 50%, this means that the currency group is weak while the rate above 50% means that the currency group is strong. You will sell the currency group with weak rating while you will buy currency group with strong rating.   </p>
<p>It may not be easy taking trades on each currency pair for the group, you will need a software to trade them together simultaneously, <strong>you can purchase our &#8220;Basket Trading Panel&#8221; Utility for such tasks</strong> and you will find basket trading an enjoyable and easy task otherwise be ready to take each trade on each currency of the group.   </p>
<p>I may have to sound a note of warning, if you are not used to basket trading and you love to learn how to do it properly, you must start with demo trading and practice a lot of money-management with your account. But if you are a basket trader before, then you have the right tool for your basket trading.   </p>
<p><strong>POSITIONING:</strong>  </p>
<p>You can decide to place your Mini-Currency Strength Meter anywhere on your chart window through the parameter setting.   </p>
<p>Up/down Shift: 20 // Default setting, feel free to adjust according to your preference  </p>
<p>Left/Right Shift: 20 // Default setting, feel free to adjust according to your preference   </p>
<p><strong><em>Other parameters:</em></strong>  </p>
