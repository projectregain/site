<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Expert adviser  <strong>PA Inside Bar</strong> &#8211; A pure price action Forex robot trading without any indicators at all * <em>commonly known as *&#8217;Naked Trading&#8217; *- instead it search for the</em> &#8216;Inside bar&#8217;  *pattern formation on a daily time frame. The inside bar formation is a bar that having its body and wicks entirely within the range of the previous yesterdays bar. The inside bar&#8217;s high lies lower and low is located higher than yesterdays bar. When these two bars form the pattern we are looking for it&#8217;s a strong signal for a potential entry. <strong>PA Inside Bar</strong> enter the market only with pending buy/sell stop orders with either timer expiration, OCO rule (one order cancels the other) or a combination of them both, stop loss and take profit. Flexible with adjustable or fixed stops and take &#8211; in &#8216;auto&#8217; mode stop loss always fixed and calculated dependent on yesterday bar size, take profit can be adjustable as like. In manual mode both can be adjustable as like and non of them depend on the yesterdays bar size. To filter out noisy bars a bar height measurement system used and can be adjusted as like but have in mind &#8211; less height on yesterdays bar could lead to a less successful trade. Also have in mind that this robot runs on D1 and looking for a pattern match and this is also a reminder that it does not trade very often like scalpers or intra day systems! Despite this the four hour chart could be interesting to and will generate more trading activity but the downside to this &#8211; more noisy bars and less efficiency so my recommendation are &#8211; stick to daily time frame and trade more then one currency pair for best efficiency and this way also generates a bit more trades. Remember that each symbol requires at least minimum deposit of $100, so if you trade 5 symbols you need minimum $500. </p>
<p>Tested on a nearly 10 year period on D1 and a $1000 deposit with high quality Ducas copy tick data, variable spreads, swaps, slippage and commission(ECN). Spreads are not quite that important on such high time frame.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is a demo version! Works only on demo accounts. *</em><em>*</strong>Money management removed and fixed lots size 1.0 always used</em>**</p>
<p>Unlocked version you find here: <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/40434" title="https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/40434">https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/40434</a></p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No dangerous trading techniques such as hedging, averaging or any other</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use &#8211; Defaults ready to be deployed on EurUsd daily chart</li>
<li>Always pending stop orders with stop loss and take profit plus trailing stop if wanted</li>
<li>Order execution mode &#8211; <em>ECN</em> or* regular*</li>
<li><em>Atr</em> calculated stops and take</li>
<li>Powerful money management with three different risk modes</li>
<li><em>Automatic</em> stop loss or <em>manual</em> input for both stop and take</li>
<li>Deposits &#8211; Anything from $100 and up ( make sure to set proper risk management for deposit)<br />
<strong>Trading different symbols?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, but there&#8217;s a slightly little chance some of the inputs may need a fine tune like manual sl/tp and trailing. Make the adjustments with a smaller optimization to obtain proper settings. As for the pattern system itself no optimization needed ever, works on all Forex symbols! If you use &#8216;Automatic&#8217; stop loss it&#8217;s calculated using the pattern system, the only settings you need to manually set in both modes are take profit and trailing stop.</p>
<p><strong>What account works best?</strong></p>
<p>Well nothing particularly, works on most common accounts but make sure it&#8217;s  <em>*5 digits *</em>else PA Inside Bar wont work!</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>I refer to screenshots &#8211; Any questions about them, just ask!</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Expert adviser Endurance &#8211; a brand new powerful Forex robot using reduced martingale and stop loss &#8211; fully equipped with many great safety features that makes it an outstanding scalping machine. Consists of two order modules that each trade separate time frames with signals from indicators adx,ma and rsi. Adx indicator provide these two order modules every day with signals to decide if it&#8217;s safe or not to trade using momentum from higher time frame, pretty much looking for a safe market approach to trade on (this is adjustable of course but in this case default settings). Module (A) and (B) trades only if the market are quite calm and not inside a strong upside or downside trend which is not the ideal surrounding for Endurance. Module A and B have different adx momentum rules but trades simultaneously or independently depending on market situations or settings. A module&#8217;s main priority are to aim for buy opportunities and B module to aim for sell opportunities. Depending on adx rules, there could be periods without trading just in case to stay away or get caught in big moves. Hour filters each day makes it possible to limit Endurance working hours to stay within certain hours or shut the whole day off and not trade outside them beside if there&#8217;s open orders, then Endurance work on them til they closed and no more orders open up until next hour period or day.</p>
<p>Beside all this, we have a powerful news filter with all three types of news &#8211; High,mid and low which can be activated and if, well then it&#8217;s getting even better because now Endurance wont trade even if adx and rsi signal confirmed , it also now stays away from trading during selected news type(s) if there&#8217;s no current open orders. If Endurance has open orders it&#8217;ll continue working on them as normal, if they close inside news range(adjustable) no new opens up until news and range passed.</p>
<p>Supported currency pair: <em>*EurUsd *</em>only!</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Expert adviser  <strong>Acron NN Extreme</strong> &#8211; A single layer (perceptron) Neural Networks Forex robot with virtual (hidden) order management. In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.</p>
<p>This version in my series of NN advisers unleashes <em>the power of martingale system</em> which average loss orders into profit. Martingale system can only be disabled in &#8216;tester mode&#8217; and optimizations. Do not use together with other expert advisers on same account as the adviser depending on the whole equity alone! Trading multiple charts with Acron NN Extreme alone on same account is fine. It&#8217;s queue system make sure all trades on one chart is closed before processing new signals on other charts. </p>
<p>Default settings been trained under 3 months from * 2019/06/04 to 2019/09/07 <em>on <strong>EurUsd *</em>time frame <em>*H1</strong>. It&#8217;s advisable to use *default</em> settings only on this pair and time frame! As described, there are four set of weights that needs attention (supervised learning). These are the main inputs to focus on while optimizing. More over there&#8217;s a virtual order management system which monitor the executed order itself with hidden take profit, stop loss and trailing stop. These virtual inputs should be optimized as the last step or leave it completely off and let adviser decide when to close the order with use of reversed signal detection which in this case function as a take or stop to the order only if there&#8217;s one (1) open order that&#8217;s not triggered by martingale system.</p>
<p>Keep learning period quite short(1-3 months). Optimization preferable on each tick or use the faster method &#8216;control points&#8217;. Even tho martingale used to bring loss orders to profit you need to optimize this adviser from time to time to avoid large draw downs. I suggest to check at tight intervals if any changes happened in the market, and if &#8211; there will be a presence of larger draw downs and it&#8217;s time to optimize!</p>
<p>Read and follow my &#8216;learning process&#8217; guide to get all things the right way. You find it <a href="https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.csrobots.n.nu/acron_extreme_learning" title="http://www.csrobots.n.nu/acron_extreme_learning">HERE</a></p>

<pre><code>**Introduction**
</code></pre>
<p><strong>H4 Trend</strong> Forex robot &#8211; An easy to use and fully automated trading robot designed to trade the H4 chart to catch trend movements. Buy/sell signals generated by crossing moving average indicator. Orders always use virtual stop loss,take profit and trailing stop and if chosen a hard stop loss. Option to close ongoing order upon a reversal signal &#8211; opposite signal and it means that the current order will close in profit/loss depending on it&#8217;s status if it didn&#8217;t hit tp/sl or trailing stop before the new signal.</p>
<p><strong>Hard stop</strong> &#8211; As H4 Trend uses virtual (hidden) order management, SL/TP and trailing levels will not be placed at the broker side. If a loss of connection occur H4 Trend cant monitor the order and that&#8217;s why hard stop needs to be there just in case the market suddenly move in the wrong direction&#8230;imagine what happen then to an order without a stop loss&#8230;.a huge loss perhaps and even a wipe out! Make sure this function always set to true no matter what! Always set hard stop greater then the virtual stop&#8230;anyway there&#8217;s a fail safe mechanism that this won&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Clown Adviser &#8211; a simple,flexible and powerful Forex robot. Don&#8217;t judge this &#8216;clown&#8217; by looking at it&#8217;s face only&#8230;behind the scene it can do more then you think of! Entry signal decisions made with the popular standard indicators Relative Strength Index and Money Flow Index. Three different types of order entries with pending stops, <strong>1 <em>*- Single entry with pending stop order above or below price direction,</strong> 2 <strong>&#8211; OCO (one cancel the other) mode with pending stop orders on each side of the price, *</em>3</strong> &#8211; Martingale type averaging or just a single pending stop order with stop loss and take profit. </p>
<p>Do not use together with other expert advisers on same account as the adviser depending on the whole equity alone if martingale used,else it works fine with others to! Trading multiple charts with Clown Adviser alone on same account is fine. It&#8217;s queue system make sure all trades on one chart is closed before processing new signals on other charts. </p>
