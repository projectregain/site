<p>### Swing Trading</p>
<p>TheFisher is an Expert Advisor built to perform Swing Trading both bull and bear trend of the EUR/JPY pair. It is a specialized trading system which targets the characteristics of the EUR/JPY pair to capitalize pips movement for its volatility.</p>
<p>EA&#8217;s target is to enter early in the beginning of the trend pro-actively to maximize movement of the trend in short to medium term using 1 hour chart for entry.</p>
<p>### Advanced Real Trading Techniques</p>
<p>The EA uses advanced FX Trading strategy which derived from real-world trading methodologies like Statistical Analysis, Technical Analysis and Advanced Risk/Money Management methods.</p>
<p>Trade with a peace of mind without the worry of blowing your account with strict trading limits imposed like institutional traders.</p>
<p>### Realistic &amp; Consistent</p>
<p>TheFisher is also a down-to-earth realistic trading EA which does not required high winning rates to be positive since Year 2000. It focuses on quality wins instead of quantity wins.</p>
<p>The returns was distributed rather evenly since 2000 to current year so you can be more confident that so far no one single year is a downer to previous performances</p>
<p>### Trend is your friend &amp; Compounding Is your Spouse</p>
<p>With the performance and stability of the Strategy, users can consider using Account Scaling method to deposit additional funds at the end of each year to enhance the effects of the compounding.</p>
<p>### Dedicated Trading Account</p>
<p>TheFisher EA requires a dedicated trading account for Risk/Money Management. It is recommended to place other manual trades in a separate trading account.</p>
<p>### TheFisher EA in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Short to Medium Term Swing Trading</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>1 mth rental not available as it is not as useful and may waste your money.</p>
