<p><em>*THIS IS FOR TRADERSWAY BROKER clients ONLY! *</em></p>
<p>Why waste time not knowing when to get out of a trade, or why risk entering the wrong trade? The EURUSD risk warning indicator tells you when to get out, but also when to get into a trade and when to consider just long or just short trades. It also reveals hidden gaps, where EURUSD will be attracted to, never place stops in the path of recent hidden gaps and you will be way ahead of other traders!  </p>
<p>This Indicator relies on intermarket analysis, using EURCHF, EURAUD, AUDUSD and the USDCHF pairs, to generate signals on EURUSD only! In order for the indicator to work, all these pairs must be available on the MT4 platform. The fundamental idea relies on EURCHF and how money flows in and out of safe haven markets and in and out of risk markets. EURO being a risk market and Swiss Franc being a safe haven market&#8230; As the idea evolved, the indicator improved by adding the other pairs.</p>
<p>This indicator takes some time to learn, but it does work well in providing exit signals and warnings. It is hard to use because markets are hard to trade, it couldn&#8217;t be otherwise. And it is a specialized indicator, specifically developed for EURUSD, as I only develop and test specialized algorithms. I have been studying the markets for 18 years, and have found that generic strategies don&#8217;t work!   </p>
<p>This indicator is currently being used in an experimetal highly complicated EA that I am developing, where the objective was for this indicator to cut through the volatility of EURUSD. So that the trade in question is exited at better profit, before price reverses off the high/low, and to also avoid entering trades when the indicator warns so. Eventually after about one year of trial and error, a proper exit indicator was made.  </p>
<p>1)The indicator consists of a blue and orange line, these lines express intermarket supply/demand forces of the other pairs relative to EURUSD. Generally, when the blue line is above the orange line EURUSD goes up, and when the blue line is below the orange line EURUSD goes down. But this is not very useful since the blue-orange lines can overshoot each other.  </p>
<p>2)<strong>The real task of the indicator is to tell us when to get out of the trade, or whether not to trade at all. So this is indicated by the orange line! If the market has been going up and the orange line drops below the open, it&#8217;s time to get out of long trades. If the market has been going down and the orange line rises above the open it&#8217;s time to get out of short trades!</strong></p>
<p>3)<strong>When the blue and orange lines seem to momentarily exactly match the high/low (or low/high) of the latest candle, this is a sign that the high/low has been made!</strong>  </p>
<p>4)<em>*If a new candle begins, and the orange line is way above the open, all short trades should be avoided! Likewise, if the orange line is way below the open, all long trades should be avoided! *</em></p>
<p>5)It was found that the indicator also reveals <strong>hidden gaps between EURUSD and the related pairs</strong>. These gaps are formed by either or both lines, and indicate levels of supply/demand, that EURUSD will likely fill these gaps and stall at those levels. It&#8217;s not a directional indicator, but it works just like gaps in classic charting theory.  </p>
<p>Basic gap theory:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.keepandshare.com/doc9/view.php?id=20946%26da=y" title="http://www.keepandshare.com/doc9/view.php?id=20946&amp;da=y">http://www.keepandshare.com/doc9/view.php?id=20946&amp;da=y</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIm1Zj-iuXM" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIm1Zj-iuXM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIm1Zj-iuXM</a></p>
<p>All in all this indicator has worked well in manual trading, making a big difference between winning and losing in all strategies, because it helps avoid many losing trades and take profits at better levels. I personally trade between the 30min and 4 hour time frame. While gaps on charts are more complicated, but it seems when the market moves towards gaps, it usually does fill them, this happens from the 30min chart through to weekly charts.</p>
<p>The number of candles the indicator runs through is set to 150 by default, but the user can change it to any number by changing the external variable C in the settings! </p>
<p>Finally, the indicator also prints the number of seconds left for the latest candle, so that the user can look to enter trades more in the first half of the candle, this helps even more. Personally, I enter trades during the first half of a candle&#8217;s duration, and I exit the trade at any time, even in the last few seconds if necessary, I only exit the trade when the orange line tells me so.  </p>

<p>The Maverick V2 indicator is an intermarket leading indicator specifically developed for EURUSD only, and it is based on EURCHF, EURAUD, AUDUSD and the USDCHF pairs. The same market data are used, as in our EURUSD risk warning /take profit indicator. It tracks how money moves between Risk and Safe haven markets. It took an entire year to make this indicator and its algorithms.  </p>
<p>Intermarket analysis of this type allows the indicator to give solid early signals, before EURUSD&#8217;s own price does! Because it tracks the risk appetite/risk aversion trend, not the price or momentum of EURUSD itself. And this is done through a proprietary algorithm, not through classic methods. When risk appetite dominates, EURUSD will rally, and when risk aversion dominates EURUSD will fall, period!  </p>
<p>The indicator produces a thick yellow line and a thiner orange line which are set to either +5 or -5. When the yellow thick line is 5, it means that the current candle/bar on the chart is expected to be bullish, and when it is at -5 it&#8217;s expected to be bearish. </p>
<p>The orangeline works the same way and it shows the strength of the trend in more detail or the shorter term trend, such as a down 1 hour candle, which is part of an overall bullish 4 hour candle, in this case the thick yellow line will remain up while the thin orange line will go down for some time.   </p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to calculate candle time (remainign time is shown by the indicator), and to breakdown the time into 2, 3 or 4 parts. This indicator is very reliable during the 1/2 of a candle&#8217;s duration, and least reliable in the final 1/3 or 1/4, this is where the different traders will use different methods, such as different trade size depending on the timing.  </p>
<p>Signals on the 4 hour chart give you plenty of time to get reliable readings, as 1/2 of a candle is 2 entire hours. All the trader has to do is watch the lines and see when the orange line may give a warning. Or use together with other indicators to time the exit/profit level etc.  </p>
<p>The yellow thick line is quite stable and rarely repaints, especially on the 4 hour chart it is very reliable. False signals do occur but they are rare and they tend to occur more towards the final time of a candle&#8217;s duration. That&#8217;s why the candle remaining time is also shown by the indicator.</p>
<p>If both lines are set to +5, the market is very bullish, if however later the yellow line remains at +5, and the orange line drops to -5, it signals cautions, lack of strength, possible time to get out of the trade, or even a reversal.</p>
<p>If the two lines start to disagree early after a new candle has started, for example on the 4 hour chart, and the yellowline points up to +5, and the orangeline points to -5, this is a sign that the market will drop for 30minutes to one hour, but the whole 4 hour candle remains bullish!  </p>
<p>This indicator is being further developed so as to develop 3 state indicator (buy-sell-neutral), and few more versions of this function, through more data processing, so that the function can be used to make more specific indicators or an EA.</p>
<p>This indicator however doesn&#8217;t have the kind of risk warning, wrong trade avoidance capability that our $800 indicator has, if the two are used together the trader has a much better risk assessment view, if the indicator (Maverick V2) is used on its own, it will still work but the trader will miss good exit/entry points, as only the major trend is revealed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even in this basic form, the indicator still works well.  </p>
