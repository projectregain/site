<p>The utility helps open a deal with a stop loss that does not exceed the specified amount, or to refrain from it altogether. That is, it determines the number of lots to open the deal so that the stop loss is as close as possible to the specified amount in USD without exceeding it.</p>
<p>For example, it will be indispensable when trading according to the Gerchik strategy. That is, when trading based on risks, with a fixed risk and a fixed take profit relative to stop loss. For example, if you always open deals with a risk of 10 USD and a take profit of 30 USD (3 to 1), this utility will help you to easily determine the number of lots for opening the deal to meet the conditions.</p>
<p>It also allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>set auto application of the least possible stop loss for this symbol;</p>
<ul>
<li>set take profit relative to stop loss (3 to 1, 4 to 1, etc.);</li>
<li>open a deal both by market and by placing a limit order;</li>
<li>check and avoid a deal, if take profit exceeds the boundaries of the instrument&#8217;s price channel;</li>
<li>draw a line defined as the ratio of take profit to stop loss for partially closing the deal.<br />
The stop loss level can be specified both in USD and in percentage of the balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to enter the market. Instead, you can simply track a number of lots necessary to open a trade and a take profit level. That data is displayed in the utility settings window after you set a stop loss price.</p>
<p>Launch the utility on the chart where a deal is to be opened. It is necessary to specify one parameter &#8211; the stop loss level (<em>Stop loss Price</em>). It represents the price where the stop loss is to be set. This price can be set both manually by entering a value in the corresponding field, and by moving the red line created by the utility on the chart.</p>
<p>Based on the stop loss level and other parameters, the utility determines the direction for opening a deal, the lot size, the order type for performing it (market or limit) and the take profit level.</p>
<h3>Utility parameters</h3>
