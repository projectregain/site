								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code><br />
Author : Samuel Achenbach<br />
Category : Experts<br />
Last Update : 1 November 2018<br />
Rent Price :<br />
Version : 2.0<br />
</code></p>
<p>This is my EA that I use to optimise my live trading EA&#8217;s (SamAchEA) input parameters.</p>
<p>I will give this EA and the live trading EA (SamAchEA )away for free.</p>
<p>This live trading EA allows you to nominate which money and risk management method to use, including the option to use martingale. <br />
I obviously do not recommend you use the martingale option &#8211; my set files (provided in the discussion page) use the &#8216;risk percent of free margin&#8217; as money and risk management method. <br />
The maximum risk per trade will be 1% of the accounts free margin, most are much lower. <br />
This live trading EA is the single-time-frame version as the multi-time-frame EA caused people too many issues. <br />
I have created a live signal simply to prove the performance of the EA &#8211; don&#8217;t subscribe to it; instead, head over to my products page and download it for free! <br />
I have also created a demo signal of this EA &#8211; this is in case you do want to subscribe to this EA signal; the demo signal is for free while the live signal cannot be given for free (it must be sold for $30USD minimum&#8230;). <br />
So, I am giving away my EA and my set files. <br />
Why? Because I don&#8217;t need your money but you may benefit from my strategy. <br />
I created this and the live trading EA on FxDreema &#8211; you can create nice EA&#8217;s there. <br />
Both EAs (live trading and tester) use the heiken ashi indicator as its signal provider &#8211; for up to three time-frames, if the last two heiken ashi bars were bears and the current price is below the last heiken ashi bear open, then is will sell; if they were bulls and the current price is above the last heiken ashi bull open, it will buy. <br />
The EAs check this condition once per bar, that&#8217;s it. <br />
This check per bar is regulated by the base time-frame that is selected &#8211; this means that you can select three time-frames and then install the EA on any time-frame (unless one of the three time-frames is set as current, then the time-frame you install the EA on is important). <br />
The rest is a matter of optimising for the best SL and TP levels. <br />
If you have questions, PM me or open a discussion. <br />
God bless you!    <a href="#description">more&#8230;</a>  </p>
